# Newton-Raphson-Method
definition: The Newton-Raphson method (also known as Newton's method) is a way to quickly find a good approximation for the root of a real-valued function f(x)=0. It uses the idea that acontinuous and differentiable function can be approximated by a straight line tangent to it.
We Know, eq. of tangent is : y-y1 = f'(x) (x-x1).
Y-f(Xo) = f'(xo)*(X-Xo)
0-f(Xo) = f'(Xo)*(X1-Xo); (putting y = 0)
=> X1 = Xo- (f(Xo)/f'(Xo))
Hence,
Xn+1= Xn-(f(Xn)/f'(Xn)
